# Datasheet for BembaSpeech ASR Corpus

## Motivation

***For what purpose was the dataset created? Was there a specific task in mind? Was there a specific gap that needed to be filled? Please provide a description.***

The motivation for creating the BembaSpeech is to create a speech recognition dataset for Bemba language that can be used to train and test speech recognition systems. It was created intentionally with that task in mind. The gap that we needed to fill is the non-existence of linguistic resources (speech and textual) for developing NLP systems in Bemba. To our knowledge this is the first ASR created for any Zambian language.
