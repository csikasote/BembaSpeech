# Data Sheet for BembaSpeech 

## Motivation
-------------

***For what purpose was the dataset created? Was there a specific task in mind? Was there a specific gap that needed to be filled? Please provide a description.***

> The BembaSpeech dataset was created to provide speech data that can be used for training and testing speech recognition models in the Bemba language of Zambia. The dataset was created for the specific task of transcribing spoken language to text in Bembna language.

***Who created this dataset (e.g., which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (e.g., company, institution, organization)?***

> The dataset was created by Claytone Sikasote of the University of Zambia, Zambia and Antonios Anastasopoulos of George Mason University, United States of America.

***Who funded the creation of the dataset? If there is an associated grant, please provide the name of the grantor and the grant name and number.***

## Composition
--------------

***What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (e.g., documents, photos, people, countries)? Are there multiple types of instances (e.g., movies, users, and ratings; people and interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a description.***

> Each instance is a pair of the audio file (in wave format) with the transcription in Bemba.

***How many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)?***

> The dataset consist of 14, 438 utterances with their respective transcripts culmination into a total of 24 hours of read speech for the Bemba language.

***Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set? If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the sample representative of the larger set (e.g., geographic coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger set, please describe why not (e.g., to cover a more diverse range of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).***
