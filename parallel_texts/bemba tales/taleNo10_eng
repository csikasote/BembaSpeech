The Tale Of Animals And Water
Once upon a time, people lived as we live today.

One day, all the animals gathered to discuss what they were going to do about the problem of water. Their only source of water, the game-pit, was completely dry. And so the animals wanted to find out, “who among them could fill the game-pit with water?” They agreed to form a circle.  

The elephants, bushbuck and all kinds of animals formed a big circle. Then they asked, “who will be the first to start the song so that the game-pit  can start filling up with water?”

“It is the elephant,” they answered in unison. 

The elephant went to the centre of the circle and started the song:
 
The game pit that was dug by the animals,
you animals, turn,
the game pit that was dug by the animals,
you animals, turn,
the big elephant tries to fill it up with water,
you animals, turn,
you animals, turn,
you animals.  

The elephant failed to produce water.

“Call the eland,” they said.  The eland went to the centre of the circle and started singing: 

The game pit that was dug by the animals,
you animals, turn,
the game pit that was dug by the animals,
you animals, turn,
the big eland tries to fill it up with water,
you animals, turn,
you animals, turn,
you animals.  

Not a single drop of water was seen.  

Next, they picked on the buffalo who sang the usual song. However, there was no change in the situation.   

After the buffalo, the tortoise offered himself.  “Please allow me.  I can sing,”  he pleaded.  However, the animals laughed off the request. ”You! Your stature is too small to fill this up with water! It’s better to try the hippo that lives in water. It may be able to fill up the game-pit with water.” Hippo was asked to go to the centre of the circle. “Start the song, Mr Hippo!” 

The game pit that was dug by the animals,
you animals, turn,
the game pit that was dug by the animals,
you animals, turn,
the big hippo tries to fill it up with water,
you animals, turn,
you animals, turn,
you animals.   

Just like all the rest of the animals, Mr. Hippo failed to produce the water to fill up the game-pit.  

“Well, what shall we do?” the animals wondered.  “Ah ha,   Mr Rabbit, you are the clever one, you go ahead.” The rabbit stepped forward and started singing: 

The game pit that was dug by the animals,
you animals, turn,
the game pit that was dug by the animals,
you animals, turn,
the big rabbit tries to fill it up with water,
you animals, turn,
you animals, turn,
you animals.  

The situation remained the same.    

Then Tortoise crawled back again, “Young people,” he said, “let me assist you!”   The animals said, “Let  Tortoise try, he may cause the water to fill up.” However, they gave him a condition.  “If you do not fill up this game-pit with water, you will see what we will do to you.”  Moving slowly, Tortoise went and sat in the middle of the circle.  

The game pit that was dug by the animals,
you animals, turn,
the game pit that was dug by the animals,
you animals, turn,
the big toirtoise tries to fill it up with water,
you animals, turn,
you animals, turn,
you animals.    

To the amazement of all the animals, the game pit was filled with water. 

And to appreciate his effort, the animals took Tortoise to the Chief who gave him a big prize.     

Respectfully, that is how I heard it (the tale)
