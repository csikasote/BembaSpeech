# Bemba-ASR-Corpus

### Introduction
The Bemba-ASR-Corpus is an automatic speech recognition(ASR) dataset for Bemba language based on speech utterances recorded from text scripts obtained mostly from      Bemba  literature books.  The dataset has over 14, 000 utterances culminating into 24hours of speech data. The motivation for building the Bemba-ASR-Corpus is to create a speech recognition dataset for Bemba language that can be used to train and test speech recognition systems.

### Dataset definition
The corpus is divided into training/validation/test datasets. In each dataset, there are three types of files:
1. Acoustic signal files, which are named as *_elicit_XX.wav, where XX is the identical code. All signal files are encoded in Waveform Audio File Format (WAVE) from a mono recording, with a sample rate of 16K Hz.

2. Description/Metadata files, encoded in JSON format for each utterance, including the corresponding description information for each acoustic signal file, such as speaker details.
