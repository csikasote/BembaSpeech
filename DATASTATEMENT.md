## A. CURATION RATIONALE 

> The Bemba-ASR-Corpus is an automatic speech recognition(ASR) dataset for Bemba language based on speech utterances recorded from text obtained mostly from Bemba literature books.  The dataset has over 15, 000 utterances culminating into 25hours of speech data. The motivation for building the Bemba-ASR-Corpus is to create a speech recognition dataset for Bemba language that can be used to train speech recognition downstream tasks on. 

## B. LANGUAGE VARIETY/VARIETIES

> The language considered in this corpus is Bemba (ISO 639-3 bem). Bemba is a bantu languages native to north-eastern Zambia. The language is also spoken in some parts of Democratic Republic of Congo, Tanzania as well as Botswana.

## C. SPEAKER DEMOGRAPHIC

> Speakers were directly approached to create audio utterances by eliciting text scripts in the Lig-Aikuma mobile application. The speakers were selected based on their fluency to speak and read Bemba and not necessarily native language speakers. It is, however, expected that some, but not all, of the speakers speak Bemba as a native language. They were ten speakers of which five are male and five female. Based on the information provided for in the metadata by the speakers, almost all speakers were aged between 22 and 28 years and, all of them arfe identified to be black. In terms of occupation, all the speakers are university students. 
 
## D. ANNOTATOR DEMOGRAPHIC
> Annotator demographic information does not exist in this dataset.

## E. SPEECH SITUATION

> The corpus comprises of the speech utterances that were recorded from scripts using the Lig-Aikuma application using the text elicitation mode. The recordings were done in Zambia at the University of Zambia between 20th August, 2020 and 12th October, 2020.

## F. TEXT CHARACTERISTICS

> Most of the text in the dataset is from private and publicly available Bemba literature books. Some of it was obtained from transcriptions of movies and recorded TV/radio programs. A small portion of approximately 5% was obtained from a Christian magazine. 

## G. RECORDING QUALITY

> The audio utterances were recorded using the Lig-Aikuma mobile application by eliciting texts that are tokenized at sentence level. Almost all recordings were not done in closed and soundproof environment. Therefore, It is expected that there would be some background noise.

## H. OTHER

> Some of the texts contained in this dataset have been used without permission. Written already to copyrights onwers waiting for their response. 

## I. PROVENANCE APPENDIX

> Nothing contained in this dataset has been gotten from an already existing dataset. Therfore, provenance appendix does not exist.
